### Build and Deployment

Once the obfuscation is complete, you can build and deploy the<b> obfuscated version </b> of your code which will be available in the directory `/codefend-output`.

The benefit of this approach is that instead of building and deploying the <b>original version</b> of your code, you will be building and deploying the <b>obfuscated version</b>, which is <b>irreversible</b> ðŸ’ª.

You can also combine Codefend with your existing uglifiers, This provides an extra layer of security through multi-layer obfuscation. you can enhance your code's security and achieve complete protection, ensuring a robust defense mechanism against reverse engineering attempts.
