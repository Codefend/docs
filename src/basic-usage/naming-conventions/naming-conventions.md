# Naming Conventions

<b><u>The primary and crucial requirement </u></b> for Codefend is that you, as a programmer, <b>follow the following naming conventions</b>:

- [Folders and Files Naming Convention](folders-files-naming-convention)
- [Code Naming Convention](code-naming-convention)

By adhering to this convention, Codefend's parser can successfully detect these elements across various programming languages and obfuscate them effectively, ensuring comprehensive protection.

:::tip Only Folders and Files naming convention
If you have an existing project and prefer not to make significant changes, you can opt to apply the naming convention only to the folders, file names, and their corresponding imports. This way, the structure of your project will be obfuscated while the code remains intact. [Learn more](folders-files-naming-convention).

:::tip Only Code naming convention
Alternatively, you can choose to strictly follow the naming convention for the code itself, ensuring that the code is obfuscated without altering the folder and file names. [Learn more](code-naming-convention).

:::tip Maximum Security
For the highest level of protection, it is advisable to implement both approaches simultaneously - applying the naming convention to both the code and the folders/file names. This comprehensive approach will provide maximum security for your project.

:::tip Want to change the naming convention?
While we recommend using the default naming convention, you also have the option to create your own custom naming convention. [Learn more](../../advanced-usage/parser/custom-naming-convention.md).
