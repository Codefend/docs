# Multi-layer Obfuscation

Codefend is not your typical code protector â€“ it's something special. Instead of directly obfuscating your final output, it takes a different path. First, it generates an obfuscated version of your original `source code`, saving it in a new folder. This simple change brings in a world of benefits, greatly enhancing the security of your project.

The best part? The obfuscated version of your source code, stored in the new folder, becomes a complex puzzle. So, even if a cunning hacker manages to decompile your code, all they will find is the obfuscated version, not your actual source code. It's like having a hidden secret code within another secret code, providing an extra layer of protection against reverse engineering attempts!

And there's more to it. You can add an extra layer of protection. Once your source code is obfuscated in the new folder, you have the option to apply even more obfuscation or uglification to the `build` output when creating the final obfuscated version of your code. This double-layered approach makes it incredibly challenging for anyone to understand or mess with your code, even if they manage to crack the initial obfuscation.

In a nutshell, Codefend is all about multi-layer protection for your source code. By cleverly concealing your code through multiple steps, it keeps it safe from prying eyes and ensures your intellectual property remains secure. So, you can rest easy knowing your hard work is well-protected.
