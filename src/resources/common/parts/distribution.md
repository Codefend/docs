#### Troubleshooting, Building, and Deployment

After successfully obfuscating your code, you'll have two versions: the original source code and the obfuscated one.

To ensure the obfuscated code works just like the original, run it and perform thorough testing. If you encounter any issues, refer to the [troubleshooting guide](../../../distribution/troubleshooting.md). Once you're confident it's working as expected, proceed with building and deploying the obfuscated code. This will create a protected version that you can share without revealing your original source code.

For more detailed instructions on building and deploying, check out this [section](../../../distribution/build-and-deployment.md).
