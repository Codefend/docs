# Codefend

Codefend is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to enhance the security of your codebase by means of a specific unconventional obfuscation technique.

What sets Codefend apart is its ability to work with all programming languages and frameworks, ensuring source code protection regardless of your development environment.

Unlike traditional code protectors, Codefend takes a unique approach. Instead of directly obfuscating your final output during the build process, it generates a source code from your existing code, effectively creating a hidden secret code within another secret code.

To use Codefend effectively, all you need to do as a programmer is follow a specific [naming convention](../basic-usage/naming-conventions/naming-conventions.md). Once this requirement is met, the tool will function seamlessly, providing you with strengthened code security.

Key Features:

- <b>Universality</b>: Works seamlessly with any programming language or framework.
- <b>Irreversible Protection</b>: Ensures that your obfuscated code cannot be reversed.
- <b>User-Friendly</b>: Easy to use, even for those new to code protection techniques.
- <b>Multi-Layer Obfuscation</b>: Can work with any additional obfuscator or uglifier on top of it
- <b>Enhanced Network Security</b>: Encrypt the communication between your <b>backend</b> and <b>frontend</b> projects [learn more](../advanced-usage/transformation/static-transformation.md)
